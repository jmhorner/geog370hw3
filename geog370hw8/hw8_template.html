<h1>Homework 8: Cabarrus County Recreation Facilities within a 3 mile radius of Cox Mill High School </h1>
<h2>Jacob Horner</h2>
<h3>This map answers the pressing question: how many Cabarrus County recreation facilities are within a 3 mile radius of Cox Mill High School?
    The first step to answering this question was to make a 3 mile buffer around the Cox Mill High School polygon. 
    The next step was to make a clip between the buffer layer and the Cabarrus County basemap layer.
    The clip layer indicates that there are 5 Cabarrus County recreation facilities within a 3 mile radius of Cox Mill High School.
    This information should be of great concern for everyone with ties to UNC, as it pertains to our star basketball player Leaky Black.
    Leaky Black attended Cox Mill High School during his senior year of high school. With this map, we can visualize the facilities he had access to
    during his development as an elite college basketball player.
